O: I learn a lot about Mapper class in Spring Boot, which is used to hide unnecessary data for client as well as for security purpose. Also learnt about Flyway fro data base setup. And then learn a lot about React, about components states, etc.

R: Fun

I: Mapper class is useful for doing DTO convertion and is very important when implement backend with SpirngBoot, and can create custom resposne to client. And I think react is even more fun tahn backend because I enjoy UI development and React with its stateless implemnetation provides a strongly typed style when coding UI

D: Will use more Mapper, Flyway and React
